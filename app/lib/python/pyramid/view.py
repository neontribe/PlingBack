    For example, this code in a module ``views.py``::

      from resources import MyResource

      @view_config(name='my_view', context=MyResource, permission='read',
                   route_name='site1')

    Might replace the following call to the

       import views
       from resources import MyResource
       config.add_view(views.my_view, context=MyResource, name='my_view',
                       permission='read', 'route_name='site1')

    Or might replace the following ZCML ``view`` declaration::

      <view
       for='.resources.MyResource'
       view='.views.my_view'
       name='my_view'
       permission='read'
       route_name='site1'
       />

    .. note: :class:`pyramid.view.view_config` is also importable, for
             backwards compatibility purposes, as the name
             :class:`pyramid.view.bfg_view`.

    The following arguments are supported as arguments to
    :class:`pyramid.view.view_config`: ``context``, ``permission``,
    ``name``, ``request_type``, ``route_name``, ``request_method``,
    ``request_param``, ``containment``, ``xhr``, ``accept``,
    ``header`` and ``path_info``.

    ``context`` should be a Python object or :term:`dotted Python
    name` representing the context type that must be found for this
    view to be called.  If ``context`` is not supplied, the interface
    ``zope.interface.Interface`` (matching any context) is used.  An
    alias for ``context`` is ``for_``.

    If ``permission`` is not supplied, no permission is registered for
    this view (it's accessible by any caller).

    If ``name`` is not supplied, the empty string is used (implying
    the default view name).

    If ``attr`` is not supplied, ``None`` is used (implying the
    function itself if the view is a function, or the ``__call__``
    callable attribute if the view is a class).

    If ``renderer`` is not supplied, ``None`` is used (meaning that no
    renderer is associated with this view).

    If ``wrapper`` is not supplied, ``None`` is used (meaning that no
    view wrapper is associated with this view).

    If ``request_type`` is not supplied, the interface
    :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IRequest` is used, implying the
    standard request interface type.

    If ``route_name`` is not supplied, the view configuration is
    considered to be made against a URL that doesn't match any defined
    :term:`route`.  The use of a ``route_name`` is an advanced
    feature, useful only if you're also using :term:`url dispatch`.

    If ``request_method`` is not supplied, this view will match a
    request with any HTTP ``REQUEST_METHOD``
    (GET/POST/PUT/HEAD/DELETE).  If this parameter *is* supplied, it
    must be a string naming an HTTP ``REQUEST_METHOD``, indicating
    that this view will only match when the current request has a
    ``REQUEST_METHOD`` that matches this value.

    If ``request_param`` is not supplied, this view will be called
    when a request with any (or no) request GET or POST parameters is
    encountered.  If the value is present, it must be a string.  If
    the value supplied to the parameter has no ``=`` sign in it, it
    implies that the key must exist in the ``request.params``
    dictionary for this view to 'match' the current request.  If the value
    supplied to the parameter has a ``=`` sign in it, e.g.
    ``request_params="foo=123"``, then the key (``foo``) must both exist
    in the ``request.params`` dictionary, and the value must match the
    right hand side of the expression (``123``) for the view to "match" the
    current request.

    ``containment`` should be a Python object or :term:`dotted Python
    name` representing a class or interface type which must be found
    as one of the context's location parents for this view to be
    called.  If ``containment`` is not supplied, this view will be
    called when the context of the request has any (or no)
    :term:`lineage`.  If ``containment`` *is* supplied, it must be a
    class or :term:`interface`, denoting that the view'matches' the
    current request only if any graph :term:`lineage` node possesses
    this class or interface.

    If ``xhr`` is specified, it must be a boolean value.  If the value
    is ``True``, the view will only be invoked if the request's
    ``X-Requested-With`` header has the value ``XMLHttpRequest``.

    If ``accept`` is specified, it must be a mimetype value.  If
    ``accept`` is specified, the view will only be invoked if the
    ``Accept`` HTTP header matches the value requested.  See the
    description of ``accept`` in :ref:`view_directive` for information
    about the allowable composition and matching behavior of this
    value.

    If ``header`` is specified, it must be a header name or a
    ``headername:headervalue`` pair.  If ``header`` is specified, and
    possesses a value the view will only be invoked if an HTTP header
    matches the value requested.  If ``header`` is specified without a
    value (a bare header name only), the view will only be invoked if
    the HTTP header exists with any value in the request.  See the
    description of ``header`` in :ref:`view_directive` for information
    about the allowable composition and matching behavior of this
    value.

    If ``path_info`` is specified, it must be a regular
    expression. The view will only be invoked if the ``PATH_INFO``
    WSGI environment variable matches the expression.

    If ``custom_predicates`` is specified, it must be a sequence of
    :term:`predicate` callables (a predicate callable accepts two
    arguments: ``context`` and ``request`` and returns ``True`` or
    ``False``).  The view will only be invoked if all custom
    predicates return ``True``.

    See the :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view`` method for
    descriptions of the ``decorator`` and ``mapper`` arguments.

    Any individual or all parameters can be omitted.  The simplest
    :class:`pyramid.view.view_config` declaration is::

        @view_config()
        def my_view(...):
            ...

    Such a registration implies that the view name will be
    ``my_view``, registered for any :term:`context` object, using no
    permission, registered against all non-URL-dispatch-based
    requests, with any ``REQUEST_METHOD``, any set of request.params
    values, without respect to any object in the :term:`lineage`.

    The ``view_config`` decorator can also be used as a class decorator
    in Python 2.6 and better (Python 2.5 and below do not support
    class decorators)::

        from pyramid.response import Response
        from pyramid.view import view_config

        @view_config()
        class MyView(object):
            def __init__(self, context, request):
                self.context = context
                self.request = request
            def __call__(self):
                return Response('hello from %s!' % self.context)

    In Python 2.5 and below, the ``view_config`` decorator can still be
    used against a class, although not in decorator form::

        from pyramid.response import Response
        from pyramid.view import view_config

        class MyView(object):
            def __init__(self, context, request):
                self.context = context
                self.request = request
            def __call__(self):
                return Response('hello from %s!' % self.context)

        MyView = view_config()(MyView)

    .. note:: When a view is a class, the calling semantics are
              different than when it is a function or another
              non-class callable.  See :ref:`class_as_view` for more
              information.

    .. warning:: Using a class as a view is a new feature in 0.8.1+.

    The ``view_config`` decorator can also be used against a class
    method::

        from pyramid.response import Response
        from pyramid.view import view_config

        class MyView(object):
            def __init__(self, context, request):
                self.context = context
                self.request = request

            @view_config(name='hello')
            def amethod(self):
                return Response('hello from %s!' % self.context)

    When the ``view_config`` decorator is used against a class method,
    a view is registered for the *class* (as described above), so the
    class constructor must accept either ``request`` or ``context,
    request``.  The method which is decorated must return a response
    (or rely on a :term:`renderer` to generate one). Using the
    decorator against a particular method of a class is equivalent to
    using the ``attr`` parameter in a decorator attached to the class
    itself.  For example, the above registration implied by the
    decorator being used against the ``amethod`` method could be
    spelled equivalently as::

        from pyramid.response import Response
        from pyramid.view import view_config

        @view_config(attr='amethod', name='hello')
        class MyView(object):
            def __init__(self, context, request):
                self.context = context
                self.request = request

            def amethod(self):
                return Response('hello from %s!' % self.context)

    To make use of any ``view_config`` declaration, you must perform a
    :term:`scan`.  To do so, either insert the following boilerplate
    into your application registry's ZCML::
    
      <scan package="."/>

    See :ref:`scan_directive` for more information about the ZCML
    ``scan`` directive.

    Or, if you don't use ZCML, use the
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.scan` method::
