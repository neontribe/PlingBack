Description: == Talis Triplestore Python API ==
        
        This small module is intended to provide an API similar to
        that of rdflib.Graph used to store and query data in a
        Talis triplestore.
        
        The module depends on rdflib, and arguments passed in as
        well as values returned are one of its URIRef, Literal or
        other Node types.
        
Platform: all
