Description: venusian
        ========
        
        Venusian is a library which allows framework authors to defer
        decorator actions.  Instead of taking actions when a function (or
        class) decorator is executed at import time, you can defer the action
        usually taken by the decorator until a separate "scan" phase.
        
        See the "docs" directory of the package or the online documentation at
        `http://docs.repoze.org/venusian <http://docs.repoze.org/venusian>`_.
        
        
        Change Log
        ==========
        
        0.6 (2011-01-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Some metaclasses (Elixir's) don't raise an AttributeError when asked for a
          nonexistent attribute during a scan.  We now catch all exceptions when
          interrogating an object for ``__venusian_callbacks__`` rather than just
          AttributeError.
        
        0.5 (2010-12-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Make ``codeinfo`` attribute available as an attribute of the AttachInfo
          object. It will be a tuple in the form ``(filename, lineno, function,
          sourceline)`` representing the context of the venusian decorator.  Eg.
          ``('/home/chrism/projects/venusian/tests/test_advice.py', 81,
          'testCallInfo', 'add_handler(foo, bar)')``
        
        0.4 (2010-09-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Bug fix: when a venusian decorator used as a class decorator was
          used against both a class *and* a subclass of that class, the
          superclass and subclass would effectively share the same set of
          callbacks.  This was not the intent: each class declaration should
          have its own local set of callbacks; callbacks added via decorations
          should not be inherited, and a superclass should not receive its
          subclass' decorations.
        
        - Arrange test fixtures into a single directory.
        
        0.3 (2010-06-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Ignore orphaned modules (``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files without a
          corresponding ``.py`` file) during a scan.
        
        0.2 (2010-04-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Add the concept of scan categories (see the "Scan Categories"
          section of the documentation) to allow an application to make use of
          more than one Venusian-using framework simultaneously.
        
        0.1 (2010-02-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
