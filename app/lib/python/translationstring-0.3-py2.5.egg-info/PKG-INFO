Description: translationstring
        =================
        
        A library used by various `Repoze <http://repoze.org>`_ packages for
        internationalization (i18n) duties related to translation.
        
        This package provides a *translation string* class, a *translation
        string factory* class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a
        utility that helps `Chameleon <http://chameleon.repoze.org>`_
        templates use translation facilities of this package.  It does not
        depend on `Babel <http://babel.edgewall.org>`_, but its translation
        and pluralization services are meant to work best when provided with
        an instance of the ``babel.support.Translations`` class.
        
        Please see `http://docs.repoze.org/translationstring
        <http://docs.repoze.org/translationstring>`_ or the ``docs/index.rst``
        file in this package for the documentation.

        =================
        
        0.3 (unreleased)
        ----------------
        
        - Preserve default translations even if they are an empty string. This
          fixes problems with Chameleon being unable to determine if a translation
          is present or not.
        
        0.2 (04-25-2010)
        ----------------
        
        - Add ``__getstate__`` and ``__reduce__`` methods to translation
          string to allow for pickling.
        
        - Fix bug in ChameleonTranslate.  When ``i18n:translate`` was used in
          templates, a translation string was inappropriately created with a
          ``default`` value of the empty string.  Symptom: template text would
          "disappear" rather than being returned untranslated.
        
        0.1 (04-24-2010)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
