Groupback - collecting feedback on the spot
*******************************************

Overview
========

Groupback is a simple web application which uses the Fastfeedback widget to 
collect feedback from multiple participants who are all present at an activity.

Groupback can be accessed by browser at http://plingback.appspot.com/groupback.html 
it works especially well on mobile devices.

Using Groupback
===============

When you first load Groupback it'll try to find you location in order to help you
choose which activity you'd like to collect feedback about. 
You may need to authorise Groupback with your browser to allow it access to your location.

Once Groupback knows where you are it'll display a list of activities for you to choose from.

Sometimes you may find that the activity you have in mind isn't listed. You can 
always enter the plings activity id (a longish number) directly to bypass this step.

Once Groupback knows which activity you're talking about it'll show a fastfeedback widget
which is ready for your first participant to use. Once each participant has finished with
fastfeedback (they can skip any bits they'd rather not answer) the widget will thank them,
countdown for a few seconds, and then re-initialise itself ready for the next participant.

Once everybody's had their say just close the browser, that's all there is to it.
